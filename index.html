						<h2>Debate Experience</h2>
					</header>
					<p>As a current Junior Varsity (JV) debater on the George Mason Debate Team, my journey in debate has been both exciting and rewarding. Last year marked my first foray into competitive debate as a novice, and I found it to be an incredibly enriching experience. The thrill of constructing arguments, the camaraderie with my teammates, and the intellectual challenge of engaging with diverse topics all contributed to my deep enjoyment of debate.
					
					Throughout the season, I had the opportunity to participate in several prestigious tournaments and achieved notable recognition and awards, including:
						<ul>
							<li>ADA Fall Championship (Semi-finalist)</li>
							<li>Harvard College Tournament (Semi-finalist)</li>
							<li>ADA Nationals 2024 (Semi-finalist)</li>
							<li>ADA Nationals 2024 (9th Speaker Award)</li>
							<li>ADA Nationals 2024 (2nd Best Novice Team of the Year)</li>

						<h2>My Love for Math</h2>
					</header>
						<p>
						My passion for math has been a defining aspect of my life since childhood. From a young age, I found comfort in the logical structure and problem-solving nature of mathematics. Whether it was solving puzzles or tackling challenging equations, math always provided a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. This deep-rooted love for math has guided my academic journey and continues to be a significant part of my life.
					    </p>
						
						<p>
						During my time at George Mason University, I have had the privilege of working with the Math Department in various capacities, sharing my enthusiasm for math with others and helping foster a love for the subject within my community. One of the highlights of my experience has been my role as a Mason Experimental Geometry Lab Outreach Intern. In this position, I reached out to over 150 students, engaging them in fun and friendly mathematical activities. These interactions not only fostered their interest in math but also highlighted the joy and beauty of mathematical thinking.
						</p>
						<p>
						Additionally, I assisted in the Mason Math Odysseys Camp for middle schoolers and the Mason Math Bootcamp. At the Math Odysseys Camp, I worked with middle school students, guiding them through engaging mathematical challenges and activities designed to spark their curiosity and deepen their understanding. During the Mason Math Bootcamp, I helped incoming students prepare for their math placement tests, ensuring they had the skills and confidence needed to excel in their required math classes.
						</p>

						<p>
						Teaching math and helping others discover its wonders has been incredibly rewarding. Seeing students' eyes light up when they grasp a new concept or solve a difficult problem is a reminder of why I love math and why I am committed to sharing this passion with others. As I continue my journey, I look forward to further opportunities to inspire and support others in their mathematical endeavors.
						I am also open to assisting with tutoring or in any other capacity. Feel free to reach out to me through the contact form on this website.

						<h2>My First Hackathon Experience</h2>
						<p>My First Hackathon Experience
							My first hackathon experience at Patriot Hack was unforgettable. Alongside my roommate and two friends, we worked on the Multipurpose Research Drone using 3D printed parts. This versatile drone could fly into various areas to collect environmental data through replaceable nose sensors, allowing for different types of data collection, such as air quality, temperature, and humidity. Our hard work and collaboration landed us the Best Startup Track award at the Patriot Hacks Hackathon, highlighting the power of teamwork and innovation.
